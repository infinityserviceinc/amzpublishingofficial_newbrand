                                <h3>What do I need to consider when choosing a ghostwriting firm?</h3>
                            </span>
                            <div class="answer">
                                <p>
                                    The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly
                                    impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service.
                                    Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick
                                    a reliable firm for all of your writing and editing needs:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Is the price right? If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a
                                    high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of
                                    expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Who owns the rights to the book?
                                    <br>

                                    It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be wary
                                    of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Who’s in charge?
                                    <br>
                                    Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final
                                    say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and
                                    requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Is the service confidential?
                                    <br>

                                    This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed
                                    manuscript unless you want it to be there.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that
                                    you are working with a reputable company with experience.
                                </p>

                                    The ghostwriting process can be as unique as you and your book! There are basic
                                    elements that are typically included in every book, however, our ghostwriting
                                    services are tailored to your specific needs and can include anything you need help
                                    with, from planning and preparation to ghostwriting to publishing.

                                    The level of writing or editing services that you need depends on the strength and
                                    clarity of your content and the stage of development it is in.

                                    If you have a well-written manuscript that just requires a final polish, copy
                                    editing is likely the best option for you.

                                    Heavy editing is best for manuscripts that are early drafts or those that were
                                    either written quickly or by an inexperienced writer.
                                </p>

                                    Absolutely! Your ghostwriter can be intimately involved with the planning and
                                    development of your concept, and they can also perform in-depth research to augment
                                    and elaborate on your topic. We can conduct interviews with you and create an
                                    outline for your book based on your ideas that you can then refine and expand with
                                    your writer before the process begins.

                                    book is unique, on average, a 200-page or 50,000-word manuscript will take between
                                    four and nine months to develop. We can often rush these services for you if you

                                    will adjust accordingly. Our skilled ghostwriters are able to shift their tone
                                    and style based on your preferences to ensure that you connect with the writing.
                                    If you are still unhappy with the writing after multiple revisions, we can

                            <div class="answer" style="">
                                <p>The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly
                                    impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service.
                                    Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick
                                    a reliable firm for all of your writing and editing needs:</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Is the price right? If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a
                                    high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of
                                    expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Who owns the rights to the book?</p>
                                <p>It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be wary
                                    of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Who’s in charge?</p>
                                <p>Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final
                                    say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and
                                    requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Is the service confidential?</p>
                                <p>This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed
                                    manuscript unless you want it to be there.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that

                                    ghostwriter or editor via phone or video call, as well as ongoing communication by
                                    email. The entire process can be adapted to best support you!</p>

                            </span>
                            <div class="answer">
                                <p>
                                    The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly
                                    impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service.
                                    Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick
                                    a reliable firm for all of your writing and editing needs:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Is the price right? If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a
                                    high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of
                                    expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Who owns the rights to the book?
                                    <br>

                                    It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be wary
                                    of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Who’s in charge?
                                    <br>
                                    Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final
                                    say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and
                                    requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Is the service confidential?
                                    <br>

                                    This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed
                                    manuscript unless you want it to be there.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that
                                    you are working with a reputable company with experience.

                                    The duration of the ghostwriting process is partly up to you—the author! Depending
                                    on your schedule and desired level of involvement, your ghostwriter will develop
                                    material for you to review and approve on a weekly or biweekly basis. While every
                                    book is unique, on average, a 200-page or 50,000-word manuscript will take between
                                    four and nine months to develop. We can often rush these services for you if you
                                    need to meet a specific publishing deadline.

                                    and influence your manuscript as the ghostwriter completes it, and you will have
                                    every opportunity to provide feedback and request revisions. Our process involves
                                    writing a small amount of material, sending it to you for feedback, making revisions
                                    based on your input, and then returning the revised content to you for approval
                                    before moving on. This method guarantees that you’ll be happy with the final result
                                    since you will have approved every page of writing leading up to the final page.

                                <h3>What do I need to consider when choosing a ghostwriting firm?</h3>
                            </span>
                            <div class="answer">
                                <p>The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly
                                    impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service.
                                    Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick
                                    a reliable firm for all of your writing and editing needs:</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Is the price right? If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a
                                    high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of
                                    expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Who owns the rights to the book? </p>
                                <p>It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be wary
                                    of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Who’s in charge?</p>
                                <p>Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final
                                    say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and
                                    requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Is the service confidential? </p>
                                <p>This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed
                                    manuscript unless you want it to be there.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that
                                    you are working with a reputable company with experience.</p>

                                    and elaborate on your topic. We can conduct interviews with you and create an

                                <p>The ghostwriting process can be as unique as you and your book! There are basic
                                    elements that are typically included in every book, however, our ghostwriting

                                <p>We can work with you as consultants and editors as you develop your content on your

                                <p>In addition to information gathering via email and phone, a standard ghostwriting

                                    process is flexible, and we are happy to customize our service to best suit your

                                <p>The duration of the ghostwriting process is partly up to you. Depending on your
                                    schedule and desired level of involvement, your ghostwriter will develop material
                                    for you to review and approve on a weekly or biweekly basis. While every book is
                                    unique, on average, a 200-page or 50,000-word manuscript will take between four and
                                    nine months to develop. We can often rush these services for you if you need to meet
                                    a specific publishing date.</p>

                                <p>The process of writing is a creative one that almost always morphs as it progresses.
                                    However, our professional writers are ready to work closely with you to ensure that
                                    the words on the page are as faithful to your vision as possible. Your writer will
                                    develop the material in small batches at a time, giving you and the ghostwriter
                                    ample opportunity to discuss and adjust the style, tone, and content of the writing.
                                    You’ll also have plenty of one-on-one interaction with your writer, which means that
                                    you’ll be able to come to a shared agreement about what you want your book to be.

                                    some people are just too busy or lack the writing skills to develop a
                                    publishable book—but their voices still deserve to be heard. A ghostwriter
                                    facilitates this process and acts as a translator between your mind and what
                                    readers can understand and enjoy. The ghostwriting process is simply a means for
                                    getting your story into the world!.</p>

                                    expectations and that there are no last-minute surprises. You will be able to
                                    review and influence your manuscript as the ghostwriter completes it, and you
                                    will have every opportunity to provide feedback and request revisions. Our
                                    process involves writing a small amount of material, sending it to you for
                                    feedback, making revisions based on your input, and then returning the revised
                                    content to you for approval before moving on. This method guarantees that you’ll
                                    be happy with the final result since you will have approved every page of
                                    writing leading up to the final page. With that said, if for some reason you’re
                                    not happy with the final product, it just means that it’s not the final product!
                                    We’ll continue to work with you until you’re satisfied with the results.</p>

                                        material for you to review and approve on a weekly or biweekly basis. While

                                    <p>There are many similarities between memoirs and autobiographies—both are
                                        nonfiction, factual accounts based on the author’s life, written in the first
                                        person—but the biggest difference is the timeframe that is covered in each
                                        genre.</p>
                                    <p>Simply put, an autobiography tells the entire story of the author’s life, while a
                                        memoir tells a specific story from parts of the author’s life. A memoir might
                                        address a particular period of time or phase of life that holds significance, or
                                        events that are all related in some way. An autobiography generally covers all
                                        aspects of the author’s life up to the time it is written, though some
                                        experiences may be given more or less emphasis to convey the desired theme or
                                        overarching message.</p>
                                    <p>When choosing whether to write a memoir or an autobiography, consider whether you
                                        would like to write your life story, from the beginning to the present day, or
                                        whether you would like to focus in on a particular period of time.</p>

                                </span>
                                <div class="answer">
                                    <p>The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it
                                        nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and
                                        trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting
                                        companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all of your writing and
                                        editing needs:</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Is the price right?</p>
                                    <p> If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book
                                        can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t
                                        be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Who owns the rights to the book?</p>
                                    <p>It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be
                                        wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Who’s in charge? </p>
                                    <p>Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the
                                        final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs
                                        and requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Is the service confidential? </p>
                                    <p>This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed
                                        manuscript unless you want it to be there.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain
                                        that you are working with a reputable company with experience.</p>

                                    book is unique, on average, a 200-page or 50,000-word manuscript will take between

                                    publishing houses that specialize in business strategy and marketing. We have

                                <p>The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it
                                    nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and
                                    trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting
                                    companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all of your writing and
                                    editing needs:</p>
                                <p>Is the price right?</p>
                                <p> If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book
                                    can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t
                                    be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.</p>

                                <p>It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be
                                    wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.</p>
                                <br>

                                <p>Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the
                                    final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs
                                    and requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.</p>

                                    your schedule and desired level of involvement, your ghostwriter will develop
                                    material for you to review and approve on a weekly or biweekly basis. While every
                                    book is unique, on average, a 200-page or 50,000-word manuscript will take between
                                    four and nine months to develop. We can often rush these services for you if you
                                    need to meet a specific publishing deadline.</p>

                                    author and initiator of your book, the ideas are all yours. Even if you don’t
                                    consider yourself a writer or are too busy to develop a publishable book, your voice
                                    still deserves to be heard. The ghostwriting process is simply a means to get your

                                <p>For more in-depth review and revisions, heavy editing includes proofreading for
                                    grammar, as well as extensive revisions to improve diction, syntax, sentence
                                    structure, flow, style, tone, and transitions. Most manuscripts require heavy
                                    editing, though we can adjust our editing and pricing according to your manuscript’s
                                    condition.</p>

                                <p>If you are looking for input on the creation of your content itself, developmental
                                    editing is a form of collaboration between author and editor in which the editor
                                    coaches the author through planning, writing, and revising their manuscript.
                                    Developmental editing addresses larger issues, such as the overarching themes and
                                    intention of the book, and includes broader suggestions and revisions to the
                                    structure, narrative, character development, voice, style, and pacing. It does not
                                    fully address spelling and grammar issues, as this is done significantly later in
                                    the process. Many first-time authors utilize a developmental editor to assist them
                                    throughout the writing process.</p>

                                    we offer options for rewriting or paraphrasing existing content, or ghostwriting

                                <h3>What is the cost of publishing a book?</h3>
                            </span>
                            <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
                                <p>The average cost to publish a book falls within the $200-$2500 range and includes
                                    publishing costs such as cover design, editing, formatting, and book printing.</p>
                                <p>However, it’s important to note that the publishing type you choose will also factor
                                    into the overall cost to publish a book.</p>
                                <p>For example, if you are traditionally publishing a book, your costs will look
                                    different than self-publishing. With traditional publishing, it is costing you time
                                    and book royalties, whereas with self-publishing it is more of an up-front cost that
                                    allows you to earn more over time.</p>

                                <p>SELF-PUBLISHING:</p>
                                <p>All online or digital book distribution options that are available to traditionally
                                    published authors are also available for self-published authors. You just have to
                                    know where to apply your book to distribute online sites like Barnes and Noble,
                                    Amazon, and other book stores.</p>
                                <p>TRADITIONAL PUBLISHING:</p>
                                <p>Traditionally published authors have more opportunities to get their books in
                                    nationwide book stores as physical copies, including airport bookstores, along with
                                    online bookstores. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Royalty Rates</p>
                                <p>SELF-PUBLISHING:</p>
                                <p>Amazon’s paperback book copy royalty rate is 60% of your book’s retail price minus
                                    the book’s print cost. So for a 300-page book that retails at $17.99, a
                                    self-published author would take home $7.54 per paperback book sold.</p>
                                <p>TRADITIONAL PUBLISHING:</p>
                                <p>First-time traditionally published authors usually make 10% per book sold until their
                                    advance is paid out, and then their earnings can go up to 12.5%. So for a book that
                                    retails at $17.99, a traditionally published author would bring $1.79 per book home
                                </p>

                                <p>SELF-PUBLISHING:</p>
                                <p>As fast as you can get through the process of good, quality book production (editing,
                                    cover design, etc.). Many authors have self-published really high-quality books in
                                    as little as 90 days</p>
                                <p>TRADITIONAL PUBLISHING: </p>
                                <p>The timeframe can take years, and even a lifetime if you never land an agent. If you
                                    do get an agent to represent you and sell your book to a house, you can still spend
                                    1-3 years before your book is actually published.</p>

                                    don’t sell. They are riddled with grammatical errors, have cheap covers, and this
                                    screams amateur. </p>
                                <p>We know that anyone can write and publish a book. But not everyone will do it right
                                    and succeed.</p>
                                <p>Remember: The average self published author, according to recent polls, earns $500 a
                                    year. That isn’t very much considering the average cost of publishing is around
                                    $1500 (and this is on a shoe-string budget).</p>
                                <p>If you want to earn more than the average, and create a stream of passive income that

                                <p>But you don’t have to spend $5,000 either. Quality does cost money, but you can still
